# Unrul Lab Screens
Video playback for Unruly Lab Screens

## Technical requirements

The current site is set to display on a 1080 x 1920 touch screen, in the most recent version of Chrome.

## Technical Setup

The code is fairly simple. 

It uses: 

- HTML5 boilerplate for HTML markup and JS plugins (index.html)
- JavaScript for controlling video playback (js/main.css)
- CSS for transition effects (css/custom.css)
- VideoJS for presenting HTML5 video (http://www.videojs.com/)
